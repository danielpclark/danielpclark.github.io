<div class="h2">SR RUBY ON RAILS DEVELOPER</div>
</div>
I am a relentless problem solver with a deep passion for crafting high-quality, maintainable, and performant software. My ability to break down complex ideas and communicate them effectively has been honed over years of experience, making me not just a developer but also a mentor and educator. I value clear communication, active listening, and thoughtful collaboration, ensuring that teams I work with thrive in both productivity and camaraderie.

I have a strong foundation in software architecture, prioritizing idiomatic code, best practices, and efficient design patterns. My expertise spans Ruby, Rust, and JavaScript, with a particular emphasis on Rails applications, systems programming, and API design. I am meticulous about writing and optimizing performant code, often using benchmarks, profiling, and testing (unit, integration, and property-based tests) to ensure reliability. My work in Dockerized environments, DevOps, and distributed systems has allowed me to design scalable, secure, and well-orchestrated infrastructures.

<b>Background:</b> My programming journey began as a child, inspired by my father, and later solidified as a passion-driven endeavor in 2001. By 2008, I was freelancing remotely, and in 2014, I transitioned into full-time software development, contributing to both Open Source and professional projects. I've worked extensively in high-scale environments, including my tenure at Pearson, where I played a key role in leading, architecting, and optimizing networked applications across Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and AWS.

<b>Ideal Team Environment:</b> I thrive in an environment that is collaborative, respectful, and driven by excellence. A team that values quality over speed, encourages mentorship, and embraces constructive peer review is where I perform best. I believe in graceful feedback, continuous improvement, and writing software that stands the test of time. Above all, I hold to the principle that people come before code, fostering a culture where individuals are valued, ideas are refined through discussion, and technical challenges are met with a spirit of shared problem-solving.

With the first release of this project, I improved my Rails site's page load times by <b>over 30%</b>. Through careful performance analysis, I identified a key bottleneck in a critical Ruby method and rewrote it in <b>Rust</b> for significant speed gains. Over time, I expanded this optimization effort, rewriting <b>15 core methods</b> in Rust, each contributing to <b>faster execution and improved efficiency</b> across the application. FasterPath continues to demonstrate the power of <b>targeted performance optimizations</b> by integrating Rust for computationally intensive operations within Ruby applications.
