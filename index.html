SR RUBY ON RAILS DEVELOPER
</div>
</div>
<p>I am a relentless problem solver with a deep passion for crafting
high-quality, maintainable, and performant software. My ability to break
down complex ideas and communicate them effectively has been honed over
years of experience, making me not just a developer but also a mentor
and educator. I value clear communication, active listening, and
thoughtful collaboration, ensuring that teams I work with thrive in both
productivity and camaraderie.</p>
<p>I have a strong foundation in software architecture, prioritizing
idiomatic code, best practices, and efficient design patterns. My
expertise spans Ruby, Rust, and JavaScript, with a particular emphasis
on Rails applications, systems programming, and API design. I am
meticulous about writing and optimizing performant code, often using
benchmarks, profiling, and testing (unit, integration, and
property-based tests) to ensure reliability. My work in Dockerized
environments, DevOps, and distributed systems has allowed me to design
scalable, secure, and well-orchestrated infrastructures.</p>
<p><b>Background:</b> My programming journey began as a child, inspired
by my father, and later solidified as a passion-driven endeavor in 2001.
By 2008, I was freelancing remotely, and in 2014, I transitioned into
full-time software development, contributing to both Open Source and
professional projects. I’ve worked extensively in high-scale
environments, including my tenure at Pearson, where I played a key role
in leading, architecting, and optimizing networked applications across
Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and AWS.</p>
<p><b>Ideal Team Environment:</b> I thrive in an environment that is
collaborative, respectful, and driven by excellence. A team that values
quality over speed, encourages mentorship, and embraces constructive
peer review is where I perform best. I believe in graceful feedback,
continuous improvement, and writing software that stands the test of
time. Above all, I hold to the principle that people come before code,
fostering a culture where individuals are valued, ideas are refined
through discussion, and technical challenges are met with a spirit of
shared problem-solving.</p>

<p>With the first release of this project, I improved my Rails site’s
page load times by <b>over 30%</b>. Through careful performance
analysis, I identified a key bottleneck in a critical Ruby method and
rewrote it in <b>Rust</b> for significant speed gains. Over time, I
expanded this optimization effort, rewriting <b>15 core methods</b> in
Rust, each contributing to <b>faster execution and improved
efficiency</b> across the application. FasterPath continues to
demonstrate the power of <b>targeted performance optimizations</b> by
integrating Rust for computationally intensive operations within Ruby
applications.</p>
